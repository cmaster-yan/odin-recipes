    <h1>Chicken Chop Suey</h1>

    <h1>Description</h1>
    <p>Chop suey has always been my favorite dish at Chinese restaurants, and after several tries I've managed to
         come up with this dish that tastes very similar to the chop suey at my favorite Chinese restaurant. There
          is a lot of chopping, but it's well worth the effort. The prep time depends on how quickly you can chop. We
           like it with vegetable fried rice or honey-garlic spare ribs</p>
    <h2>Ingredients:</h2>
    <ul>
        <li>1 teaspoon olive oil, divided</li>
        <li>4 boneless, skinless chicken thighs, cut into small pieces</li>
        <li>1 large green bell pepper, cut into strips</li>
        <li>1 large onion, sliced</li>
        <li>1 cup thinly sliced celery</li>
        <li>½ cup thinly sliced carrots</li>
        <li>¾ cup boiling water</li>
        <li>1 tablespoon soy sauce</li>
        <li>1 cube chicken bouillon</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon salt</li>
        <li>½ teaspoon white sugar</li>
        <li>2 cups bok choy, thinly sliced</li>
        <li>1 ½ cups bean sprouts</li>
        <li>2 teaspoons water</li>
        <li>1 ½ teaspoons cornstarch</li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps:</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Heat 1/2 teaspoon oil in a skillet over medium heat. Add chicken; cook until golden on the outside and no longer pink in the center, 5 to 7 minutes. Remove from skillet.</li>
        <li>Heat remaining 1/2 teaspoon oil in the skillet. Add green bell pepper, onion, celery, and carrot.</li>
        <li>Mix boiling water, soy sauce, bouillon cube, salt, and sugar together in a bowl; add to the bell pepper mixture. Bring to a simmer; cook until carrots are tender, about 7 minutes. Add bok choy and bean sprouts. Cook until bok choy is tender, about 5 minutes.</li>
        <li>Return chicken to the skillet. Mix 2 teaspoons water and cornstarch together in a bowl; pour into pan and mix. Simmer until broth thickens, 3 to 5 minutes.</li>
    </ol>
